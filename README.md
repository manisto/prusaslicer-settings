# How to install
  - Clone into the `.config` folder of the PrusaSlicer settings folder,
    so that the cloned folder is next to the `PrusaSlicer` folder.
  - Move the `.git` folder and the `.gitignore` file from the
    cloned folder (`prusaslicer-settings`) to the `PrusaSlicer` folder.
  - Restore and merge files as necessary in the `PrusaSlicer` folder.
